<h1 align="center"> DEVELOPMENT OF AN IMAGE CAPTURING UNIT FOR REMOTE MONITORING</h1>

## Problem Identification: Ever wondered to monitor your tasks remotely...!What If

<p align="center">you need to monitor the cultivational crops far away distant...!</p>
<p align="center">you need to look after your kids far away from home...!</p>
<p align="center">you need to monitor your patient remotely...!</p>
<p align="center">you need to build a cctv security system at your home...!</p>
          
<p>The advancements of modern IOT technologies and the needs of people have paved the path for remote monitoring in order to save cost,time and increase productivity.
  
  Why do we need an image capturing unit for remote monitoring systems?
  
  These types of units are used to visualize the object under investigation such that the captured images can be used to undergo further analysis and decisions can be be made based on the analysis.
  Nowadays we know that the needness for data is increasing day by day  in order to make decisions,increase productivity,make predictions and solutions. The captured images can be used as datasets for building models by data scientists and data analysts.
  We can also use this unit for remote control and manage various applications.
  
  ## Proposed Solution:
  
  <p>Our solution is to develop an image capturing unit that will meet the requirements of the clients.</p>
